excerpt: 'This research presents an ensemble Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach that combines Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms to tackle quantum control problems. This research aims to use the complementary strengths of DQN and PPO algorithms to develop robust and adaptive control policies for noisy and uncertain quantum systems. We comprehensively analyse the proposed ensemble learning, including algorithmic details, implementation specifics, and experimental results. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ensemble approach in learning control strategies for manipulating quantum systems towards a random target state. The results highlight the potential of ensemble RL techniques in addressing the challenges of quantum control tasks, such as system noise and dynamics. By integrating multiple RL agents within an ensemble framework, We aim to advance current developments in quantum control and create a new path for the development of adaptive control systems for quantum systems. The performance of the ensemble model is assessed against Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) and robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) to demonstrate its efficiency in highly challenging and noisy environments.'
