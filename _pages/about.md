I am Farshad Rahimi Ghashghaei, a researcher in quantum information science with a master’s degree in cyber security from Birmingham City University, United Kingdom. During my master’s, I focused on quantum cryptography, quantum control, and the application of artificial intelligence techniques (machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning) to quantum computation.

The foundations and applications of quantum information are the main topics of my research, with a focus on how the ideas of quantum mechanics could affect secure information processing, communication, and computation in the future. I am especially interested in the connection of quantum mechanics and information theory, and in designing quantum systems that go beyond classical limits.

With a background in physics, computer science, and cyber security, I take an interdisciplinary approach that links theoretical insights with practical applications in emerging technologies. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of scalable and efficient quantum systems that can transform how information is processed and secured.

I am preparing to apply for PhD programs with the goal of contributing to both the theory and the practical development of quantum technologies. In the meantime, I stay engaged with the field through research collaborations, workshops, and independent study, while continuing to develop my skills in quantum programming, quantum algorithms, and hybrid quantum–classical methods.
